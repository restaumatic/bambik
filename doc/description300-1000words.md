Profunctors are well researched abstractions in category theory and are widely used in functional programming.
They turn out to be closely related to optics (lenses, prisms etc) providing them an encoding (profunctor encoding).
They are also close relatives to arrows (strong profunctor semigroupoid is an arrow sans identity).
They are then behind both “data” and “control” of computation; behind both data structure and data flow.

This work presents a way in which user interfaces can be entirely expressed declaratively, in terms of both space (structure) and time (flow), by picking a proper profunctor instance as a building block of UI.
Semigroupoid, choice profunctor, strong profunctor, sum profunctor and zero profunctor alongside semigroup and monoid instances suffice to enable rich UIs and great UI development experience.
